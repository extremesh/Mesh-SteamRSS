<b>What The Script Does?</b> <br /><br />
Extracts your Steam Gaming Activity in the last 2 weeks and creates a simple RSS / XML Feed which you can use to display on any websites or for automation purposes. <br />
Will display the total 'Game time' played of a specific Game and also the amount of "Achievements" unlocked.<br />
eg. Works on IFTTT and Dlvr.It (as far I tested).<br />
