<b>What The Script Does?</b> <br /><br />
Extracts your Steam Gaming Activity in the last 2 weeks and creates a simple RSS / XML Feed which you can use to display on any websites or for automation purposes. <br />
Will display the total 'Game time' played of a specific Game and also the amount of "Achievements" unlocked.<br />
eg. Works on IFTTT and Dlvr.It (as far I tested).<br />

<b>Live Demo (With my own Steam Activity):</b> <br />

<b><ins>Limitation</ins>:</b> <br /><br />
Steam Web Api Key only provides data for data of last 2 Weeks and there is no correct 'Date' to be captured and populated in the RSS 'Date'.<br />
<br />

<b><ins>Next Version</ins>?</b> <br />
- To try and see if an estimated time can be added as date in the script.
- Add thumbnail for each game (for now you can get the AppID of the game from the permLink and get the Image).
- Simple database for storing.
- Hosting option for those with no server.
